## Instructions to Download

- First clone the repo.

- Run ```npm install```.

- Now create a .env file as there are certain environment variables required for the project.

- Now you can ask for the environment variables from the owner and set it.

- Optionally you can go to: [THE COCKTAIL DB API](https://rapidapi.com/thecocktaildb/api/the-cocktail-db)

- Now from from there you can set url as API_ENDPOINT, x-rapidapi-host as RAPID_API_HOST and x-rapidapi-key as RAPID_API_KEY.

- Finally I know an API_ENDPOINT_LOCAL is also mentioned in the environment variable but that is only for local testing with json-server. It has only been imported in ```./utils/getDrinks.js```. Please remove it from there for safe usage.
